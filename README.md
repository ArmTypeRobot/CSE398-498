<b> Description </b> <br>
This course will cover fundamental concepts, mathematics, and algorithms most relevant to serial chain robots, i.e., legs, arms, spines, fingers, and toes.  The main topics to be studied are position and orientation representations, forward and inverse kinematic maps, coordinated linkage control, basic legged locomotion and grasping.  Semester-long projects will be done in interdisciplinary teams of three students.  These projects will incorporate most of the basic topics above, but will also offer the opportunity to explore topics of interest to students that are beyond the main topics.  Assignments and labs will be done using virtual robots in simulation, but the possibility of using physical robots is be examined.

The 498 (graduate) version of this class will differ from the 398 (undergraduate) version by one or more of several possible extensions designed by the student with the approval of the instructor.  These extensions include, but are not limited to, extra homework assignments, a more extensive project, an in-class presentation of a topic of useful results from the literature.

Prerequisites: Basic programming ability (e.g., CSE 007 or CSE 012) and permission of the instructor. Students who are interested in taking the course should send a paragraph of what they'd hope to get from the course to the instructor.
